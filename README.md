# 🌦️ Weather App (Open-Meteo API)

## Project Overview
This Weather App allows users to check the current weather for any city. It uses the Open-Meteo Geocoding API to find location coordinates and then fetches weather data using the Open-Meteo Weather Forecast API.

## App Features
- Search bar to enter a city name
- Display of temperature, wind speed, and weather description
- Error message if city is not found
- Supports multiple city searches

## How to Navigate & Run the Code
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-app-open-meteo.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd weather-app-open-meteo
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser to start the app.

## Project Files
- `src/index.html`: Structure of the web page
- `src/app.js`: JavaScript logic for fetching and displaying weather data
- `src/style.css`: Styling
- `data/sample-response.json`: Sample API response for reference
- `images/`: Contains screenshots of the app

## What I Learned
- How to use APIs in JavaScript
- Handling user input and asynchronous requests
- Error handling and user feedback

## Challenges
Managing API responses and chaining asynchronous requests correctly was initially tricky.

## Future Improvements
- Add weather icons
- Improve design with CSS
- Store recent search history
